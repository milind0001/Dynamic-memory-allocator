# Dynamic Memory Allocator

## üìò Overview
**Dynamic Memory Allocator** is a custom implementation of dynamic memory management in C++.  
It mimics the behavior of standard memory allocation functions like `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, and `free`, allowing users to understand how memory management works under the hood.

This project is especially useful for systems programming learners and those interested in how memory is managed at a low level.

## üß± Key Components

### 1. Custom Heap Management
- Implements manual memory allocation and deallocation.
- Simulates heap space within user-defined memory.
- Maintains metadata for each block (e.g., size, allocation status).

### 2. Memory Block Structure
- Blocks are divided into:
  - **Used** (allocated) memory
  - **Free** (available) memory
- Includes mechanisms for:
  - Block splitting during allocation
  - Block merging during deallocation (to reduce fragmentation)

### 3. Safety & Error Handling
- Detects and prevents:
  - Double-free errors
  - Accessing freed memory
- Encourages memory-safe practices
