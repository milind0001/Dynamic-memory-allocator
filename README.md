# Memory Allocation Analyzer

# Overview
Memory Allocation Analyzer is a powerful tool designed to help developers analyze, monitor, and optimize memory usage in software applications. By providing in-depth insights into memory allocations, the tool assists in understanding how memory is utilized by different variables and structures.

# Key Components
1. **Memory Allocation Analysis**
   - Provides insights into where variables are stored in RAM (Data Section, Heap Section, Stack Section).
   - Displays the datatype, size, and scope of variables.
   - Helps in identifying inefficient memory usage.

2. **Visualization**
   - Graphical representation of memory allocation.
   - Breakdown of memory sections for better understanding.

3. **Code Analysis**
   - Parses C++ code to extract memory allocation details.
   - Identifies potential memory leaks and inefficiencies.

# Platform
- Developed using **C++, Python, Clang/LLVM, TensorFlow/PyTorch (for ML-based optimizations), Flask/Django (for web interface)**.
- Runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

# Prerequisites
- **C++ compiler (GCC/Clang/MSVC)**
- **Python environment with required dependencies**
- **Clang/LLVM for code parsing**
- **MongoDB or SQLite (for storing analysis results)**

# Usage
1. **Clone the Repository**
   
   - `git clone https://github.com/milind0001/Memory-Allocation-Analyzer.git`

2. **Install Dependencies**
   
   - `cd Memory-Allocation-Analyzer`
   - `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. **Run the Analyzer**
   
   - `python main.py --file sample_code.cpp`

4. **Access the Application**
   
   - Analyze memory usage from the terminal output.
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` (if web interface is enabled).

5. **Use the Features**
   
   - View detailed memory allocation insights.
   - Optimize memory usage based on analysis results.

# Features to be Added
- **IDE Plugin Support** (Integration with VS Code, JetBrains, etc.)
- **Advanced ML-based Memory Optimization Recommendations**
- **Support for Additional Programming Languages (C, Rust, etc.)**
